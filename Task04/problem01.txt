Task 4: The Fleet Inventory (Lists)
Scenario: You have a list: servers = ["web01", "db01", "app01", "web02"].

Goal: Use slicing to create a new list called web_servers containing only the first and last elements of the original list.

DevOps Value with this task: Managing subsets of infrastructure (e.g., "only update the first 50% of nodes").
